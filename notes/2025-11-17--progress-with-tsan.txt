using atomic bool release and aquires managed to reduce the tsan reports but it
is not satisfactory using fences does not help but it is more correct

see commit f22769be for atomic bool operations that reduces tsan reports

see commit after that using fences, now commented out until more study is being
done

changed from for_each(par_unseq to par) because par_unseq cannot access shared
data: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/execution_policy_tag_t.html

added TSAN_MODE in grid.hpp that creates a thread per row at "update" and 
"resolve_collisions" to be able run tsan on rest of code
