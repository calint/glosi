using atomic bool release and aquires managed to reduce the tsan reports but it
is not satisfactory using fences does not help but it is more correct

see commit f22769be for atomic bool operations that reduces tsan reports

see commit after that using fences, now commented out until more study is being
done

changed from for_each(par_unseq to par) because par_unseq cannot access shared
data: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/execution_policy_tag_t.html

added MODE_JTHREADS in grid.hpp that creates a thread per row at "update" and 
"resolve_collisions" to be able run tsan on rest of code. no problems in
application code reported

added fences at end of `update_pass_1` and between stages in `update_pass_2`
does effect performance

removed fences because:
From the C++ standard (§[algorithms.parallel.exec]):
Parallel algorithms have the same semantics as their sequential counterparts, 
except that they may execute in parallel.
And critically (§[algorithms.parallel.overloads]):
Unless otherwise specified, parallel algorithms shall not participate in data 
races. The implementation must ensure proper synchronization.
